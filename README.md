# ✈Project-Airlines✈
A Big data Project

Problem Statement

▪ The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by 
large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, 
delayed, canceled, and diverted flights are published in DOT's monthly Air 
Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and 
cancellations.

▪ For this Project, we used the data published by the US Department of 
Transportation (DOT). This dataset is composed of millions of 
observations and more than 30 different variables. The objective of this 
assignment is to predict the delay of commercial flights using Spark, 
Hadoop and Hive create tables and load data. 

▪ Also to create spark dataframe and perform ETL for analytical 
requirements and integrate with AWS using S3 buckets. Creating 
visualisation for business queries on different perspectives of fleet 
analysis using Tableau.
