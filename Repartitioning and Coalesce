➢ no_of_partitions = clean_flights_df.rdd.getNumPartitions()
➢ print(f"no_of_partitions are : {no_of_partitions}")

Increase number of partitions using repartition:
➢ clean_flights_df.repartition(10).write.csv("/project/outputs/repartition10_cl
ean_flights")

Repartitioning performs a full shuffle and partitions the data into roughly 
equal sized blocks.

Decreasing no of partitions using coalesce:
➢ clean_flights_df.coalesce(1).write.csv("/project/outputs/coalesce1Output")

Coalesce can only be used to reduce partitions as it does not perform a full 
shuffle like repartition. It is also faster than repartition.
